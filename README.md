# Two Types of Auto Clickers
The first is a brute force clicker, it just clicks in designated locations extremely fast.
The second looks at the screen for a particular image, and then click that image.


## How to use
This script is to be run in tandem with Py-Game-Auto-Clicker script. You can run this script at anytime. Once the tile game is run, by pressing the
<b>'m'</b> key, the script will start auto clicking. Press <b>'m'</b> again to stop the clicker. Press q to exit the clicker program.

## Technologies used
I used the following Libraries:
 <UL>
   <li>PyWin32: Used for faster clicks</li>
   <li>Pyautogui: Used for detecting the image on screen.</li>
   <li>Opencv: Used for confidence parameter. Allows for images to not be pixel perfect when searching the screen.</li>
   <li>Keyboard: Tracks inputs</li>
   <li>Time: Slows the program down so all clicks will register.</li>
 </UL>
